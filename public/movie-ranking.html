<h1>Nishant's Beast List (for Movies)</h1>

<h2>1 : Inception </h2>
<hr />
<p>Inception is a Christopher Nolan film which contains a unorthodox movie plot along with great acting and graphics which captivates the audience.</p>

<h2>2 : Interstellar </h2>
<hr />
<p>Interstellar is another movie directed by the one and only Christopher Nolan, with a very intriguing plot which makes me myself contemplate about the future of our beautiful Earth.</p>

<h2>3 : Oppenheimer </h2>
<hr />
<p>Do you want to know who directed this film? I have a feeling you know :) . This movie recounts the world wide struggles of the 1940's and what led to the creation of the atomic bomb.</p>
